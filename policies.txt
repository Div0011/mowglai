Introduction and Scope
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Mowglai (mowglai.in) collects, uses, maintains,
and discloses information collected from users and clients. We are committed to protecting your
privacy and ensuring that your personal and business data is handled with the highest level of
security. This policy applies to all services offered by Mowglai, including custom website
development, database management, and AI-driven optimizations. By utilizing our services, you
acknowledge that you have read and understood how we process your data to deliver
high-quality technical solutions.
Data Collection and Usage
We collect information through various channels, primarily during the onboarding and execution
phases of our projects. This includes personal identifiers such as names and contact details, as
well as highly sensitive technical data like server credentials, API keys, and database schemas.
This information is used exclusively to facilitate project upgrades, maintain system integrity, and
personalize your experience. We do not sell or lease your data to third parties; any data sharing
is restricted to essential service providers, such as cloud hosting or AI model processing
platforms, and is conducted under strict confidentiality agreements.
AI and Database Security
Given our specialization in AI handling and database management, Mowglai prioritizes data
minimization and encryption. When processing data through AI models, we ensure that
sensitive information is either anonymized or handled via secure API tunnels to prevent
unauthorized exposure. For database services, we implement industry-standard security
protocols to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of your stored
information. Our team continuously monitors these systems to ensure compliance with modern
data protection standards, providing you with peace of mind regarding your intellectual and
digital assets.

Engagement of Services
By accessing mowglai.in or entering into a service agreement with Mowglai, you agree to be
bound by these Terms and Conditions. Our services encompass the end-to-end lifecycle of web
development, from initial scratch-builds to complex project upgrades and SEO strategy
implementation. Each project is defined by a specific scope of work, and any deviations or
additions will be treated as supplemental tasks. We strive for excellence in every line of code
and every database query, ensuring that your digital infrastructure is robust, scalable, and
optimized for modern search engine standards.
Intellectual Property and Ownership
Mowglai believes in empowering our clients. Upon receipt of full and final payment, the
ownership of the custom source code, website designs, and database architectures created
specifically for your project will be transferred to you. However, Mowglai retains the rights to any
pre-existing code libraries, proprietary AI prompts, or general-purpose scripts used during the
development process. You are granted a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use these internal
tools as they function within your specific project. This balance ensures you own your business
assets while allowing us to continue innovating with our core technology stack.
Client Responsibilities and Data Access

To ensure the success of your project, particularly in areas like SEO and database migration, we
require timely access to your existing digital environment. You represent that you have the legal
right to provide us with access to any third-party platforms, hosting environments, or data sets
required for the task. Mowglai is not responsible for project delays caused by a lack of access or
incomplete information provided by the client. Furthermore, you are responsible for ensuring
that all content provided for your website—including text, images, and data—complies with
relevant copyright and intellectual property laws.

AI Handling and SEO Performance
Our AI-driven services and SEO optimizations are performed using the latest industry
methodologies. However, because search engine algorithms and third-party AI models (such as
those from OpenAI or Google) are subject to frequent, unannounced changes, Mowglai cannot
guarantee specific ranking positions or permanent AI output consistency. We provide "White
Hat" SEO services designed for long-term growth and implement AI logic that aims for accuracy,
but we are not liable for the independent actions of these external platforms. Our role is to
provide the best technical framework to navigate these evolving landscapes.
Limitation of Liability and Indemnification
In no event shall Mowglai, its founders, or employees be held liable for any indirect, incidental,
or consequential damages arising from the use of our services, including but not limited to loss
of data, business interruption, or system downtime during project upgrades. Our total liability for
any claim related to our services is strictly limited to the amount paid by the client for the specific
service in question. You agree to indemnify and hold Mowglai harmless from any claims or legal
fees arising from your breach of these terms or your use of the final deliverables in a manner
that violates local or international laws.
Amendments and Governing Law
Mowglai reserves the right to update these policies at any time to reflect changes in our service
offerings or legal requirements. We encourage clients to review this page periodically. These
terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Mowglai operates. Any disputes
arising from these agreements shall be resolved through good-faith negotiations or, if necessary,
through the appropriate legal channels in our local jurisdiction. Your continued use of our
services following any updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.
