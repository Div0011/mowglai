2. Terms & Conditions
Welcome to mowglai.in. By accessing this website and hiring our services, you agree to comply
with and be bound by the following terms.
Scope of Services
Mowglai provides web development, project upgrades, AI integration, SEO optimization, and
database management. Each project will be governed by a specific "Statement of Work" (SOW)
or agreement.
Intellectual Property

structures created specifically for them.

used to deliver the service.
Client Responsibilities
Clients must provide timely access to necessary accounts (hosting, SEO tools, etc.).

AI and SEO Disclaimer

AI Handling: While we implement cutting-edge AI, Mowglai is not responsible for unpredictable

Important Notes for You:

If serving California, a CCPA section is required.
Customization: Make sure to replace the "[26/01/2016]" placeholders.
Legal Review: While these templates cover the essentials for a tech agency, it is always a good
idea to have a local legal professional review them to ensure they align with Indian IT laws (like
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act).
